                <h2>Why I joined Alt School Africa</h2>
                <p>
                I joined ALT School Africa because of its reputation for equipping learners with practical, industry-relevant skills in the tech space. 
                As someone transitioning into cloud engineering, I sought a program that not only provides theoretical knowledge but also emphasizes hands-on experience

                  ideal platform for me to embark on this journey.
                 Cloud computing excites me because of its potential to revolutionize industries and drive efficiencies across multiple domains, 
                 including business operations, and entrepreneurship.
